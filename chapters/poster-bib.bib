	journal={Business Horizons},
	volume={52},
	number={4},
	pages={357-365},
	abstract={  The emergence of Internet-based social media has made it possible for one person to communicate with hundreds or even thousands of other people about products and the companies that provide them. Thus, the impact of consumer-to-consumer communications has been greatly magnified in the marketplace. This article argues that social media is a hybrid element of the promotion mix because in a traditional sense it enables companies to talk to their customers, while in a nontraditional sense it enables customers to talk directly to one another. The content, timing, and frequency of the social media-based conversations occurring between consumers are outside managers' direct control. This stands in contrast to the traditional integrated marketing communications paradigm whereby a high degree of control is present. Therefore, managers must learn to shape consumer discussions in a manner that is consistent with the organization's mission and performance goals. Methods by which this can be accomplished are delineated herein. They include providing consumers with networking platforms, and using blogs, social media tools, and promotional tools to engage customers. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

	abstract = 	 {In retail, demographics are currently regarded as the most convenient base for successful personalized marketing. However, signs point to the dormant power of context recognition. While technologies that can sense the environment are advanced, questions such as what to sense and how to adapt context are largely unanswered. In this paper, we analyze the purchase context of a retail outlet and suggest a context model for adaptive pervasive commerce. Furthermore, we introduce one approach how to conceptualize context that may be applied to conceptualize context for adaptive pervasive advertising applications so that they really deliver on their potential: showing the right message to the right recipient at the right time.}

	journal={IEEE Pervasive Computing},
	volume={5},
	number={1},
	pages={40-46},
	abstract={As the vision of pervasive computing gradually becomes a reality, we are seeing an increasing number of services in our everyday environments. We don't just access them at desktop computers but everywhere our activities lead us-using mobile terminals and built-in technology. Although a positive phenomenon, this transition also introduces considerable challenges to discovering and selecting services. The authors propose a general framework for requesting pervasive services by touching RFID tags. Visual symbols communicate to users the objects that they can touch and that activate services. When a user touches such a symbol with a mobile phone, the data stored in the tag and other contextual information related to the situation trigger the requested service. The authors designed a set of visual symbols and implemented the required functionality as component-based middleware. They studied this novel system's usability and user experience. This article is part of a special issue on RFID Technology.},

	pages={161-165},
	abstract={This paper introduces our research on influencing the experience of people in urban public places through mobile mediated interactions. Information and communication technology (ICT) devices are sometimes used to create personal space while in public. ICT devices could also be utilised to digitally augment the urban space with non-privacy sensitive data enabling mobile mediated interactions in an anonymous way between collocated strangers. We present what motivates the research on digital augmentations and mobile mediated interactions between unknown urban dwellers, define the research problem that drives this study and why it is significant research in the field of pervasive social networking. The paper illustrates three design interventions enabling social pervasive content sharing and employing pervasive presence, awareness and anonymous social user interaction in urban public places. The paper concludes with an outlook and summarises the research effort.},

	abstract={As pervasive computing technologies leave the labs, they are starting to
be used for the purpose of advertising. Pervasive Advertising has the potential to
affect everyone’s life, but it seems that a knowledge gap is preventing us from
shaping this development in a meaningful way. In particular, many marketing and
advertising professionals have an expert understanding of their trade, but are unaware
of recent advances in pervasive computing technologies, the opportunities
they offer, and the challenges they pose. Similarly, many pervasive computing researchers
and professionals are on top of the recent technological advances, but
lack basic marketing and advertising expertise and therefore an understanding of
how their technology can influence these fields. This book is intended to close this
gap and provide the means to meaningfully shape the future of pervasive advertising.},

	abstract = 	 {Abstract:           Modern communication is moving toward a digital paradigm influenced by increasing connectivity and the IoT. Digital communication can be improved by applying proximity rules to improve relevance especially for  marketing  messages.  The  objective  of  this  study  was  to  demonstrate  how  cloud  based  proximity marketing can be implemented as a service on existing wireless connectivity service platforms to deliver messages that are timely and relevant, using Wi-Fi broadcasts. Information about networking technologies and proximity determination was used to develop a prototype proximity marketing system to demonstrate the concepts of Proximity Marketing as a Service that can run on a wireless network. The prototype system Precinct PMaaS was successfully designed, implemented and tested. When compared to similar Bluetooth tools the cloud based WiFi driven Precinct PMaaS solution proved to be more efficient and effective, offering a better value proposition than Bluetooth proximity marketing tools. This study demonstrates how to achieve proximity communication cost effectively using network service information, demonstrated in a Wi-Fi only environment. This is ground work on which future projects can apply Big Data analytics to improve impact of proximity driven digital marketing.},

Although Proximity Marketing contributes to enhancing the global experience, only SENS and RELATE dimensions among the five experiential dimensions (SENS, FEEL, THINK, ACT, RELATE) are comonly solicited. The present research project unveils what the most and least used experiential dimensions are within a specific type of emerging marketing approach: proximity marketing. Suggestions for managerial implication are provided in order to optimize the experience in the field of entertainment, by means of one of the most recent marketing technology.}

	abstract = 	 {Innovative marketers can now leverage augmented reality to craft immersive brand experiences, create more interactive advertising, and enable consumers to experience products and spaces in novel ways. Augmented reality (AR) is the practice of displaying digital information over people's real-time view of objects, people, or spaces in the physical world. While AR can play a valuable role in integrated marketing programs, little is known about the practice and how to execute effective AR programs in the marketplace. We address this gap by presenting a framework that describes the active and passive ingredients of augmented reality. We then describe the basic design decisions that marketers need to make when planning an augmented reality campaign. In addition, we explain how understanding and addressing the dynamics between various active and passive AR ingredients can help marketers to optimize their AR campaigns and enhance various types of consumer engagement: user-brand engagement, user-user engagement, and user-bystander engagement. Through our framework and analysis, we develop eight actionable recommendations—described with the acronym ENTANGLE—marketing managers can use to design immersive AR experiences that maximize consumer engagement.
