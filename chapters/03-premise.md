# Literature Review

The facet of daily life this project aims to examine and expand upon is that of the interface between marketeer and consumer. 
With the rise of the web, e-commerce, social-media and online advertising the way users would interact with the products and services was re-imagined [@RefWorks:doc:5ab2cab2e4b0770b05a27381]. 
As Mangold and Faulds explore in their paper, there is now a more public relationship that has become more bi-directional than weighted towards the brand just broadcasting.

The convergence of technologies has often had the ability to transform the way we live and like the impact of the smartphone, the Internet of Things is set to trigger a paradigm shift that will transform they way we interact with the world around us; this future digital connectedness is set to re-invent advertising [@RefWorks:doc:5aaeea0fe4b03d53f0cecda3]. 
Like the 2011 Pervasive Computing article by Krumm suggests, advertising could be the 'killer app' for ubiquitous computing this century, helping induce the roll-out of infrastructure.

For over a decade the potential for a digitally connected environment has been considered a reality with the use of low cost radio technology [@RefWorks:doc:5aaeef26e4b04d63969fbe08]. 
However, it is only in recent years that it has become truly viable thanks to improvements in technology, such as telecommunications infrastructure and low-energy computing power like BLE [@RefWorks:doc:5aaafe6ee4b0392658e3edda].

The experience of engagement between consumer and provider has become more and more important as our post-industrial society has developed, the product or service itself is not the only differentiator, now the relationship between the two parties is also prized as a means of ensuring repeat business from customers [@RefWorks:doc:5a7b2167e4b020cb798b152f]. 
As 'Welcome to the Experience Economy' points out, the experience a brand provides the end consumer is increasingly the focus of the relationship.

Lastly, brand loyalty is a somewhat intangible target that businesses aim for to secure future success and new technology will attempt to improve for businesses [@RefWorks:doc:5a71e408e4b0d609eec82cef][@RefWorks:doc:5a71dc44e4b03ce0ba20a6d5], allowing them to better track loyalty and its impact on their business. 
Further to this, solutions that utilise a mixture of technology will be able to create a more engaging experience for the customer  [@RefWorks:doc:5a73ed7ee4b0645cd2d425e1] and even create experiences that reward the user for their participation [@RefWorks:doc:5a73d86ee4b05d2b53fe0bf9].
