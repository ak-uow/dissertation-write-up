#Background Context

The convergence of technologies has often had the ability to transform they way we live; the smartphone is a prime example of how many elements come together to create something deeper and richer than the constituent parts alone. The Internet of Things is a paradigm that will create a phenomenon as equally transformative as the smartphone but with the capacity to extend
beyond our pockets and our hands, instead created a feeling of connectedness that immerses us within our environment in a way as yet unrealised.
For over a decade the potential for a digitally connected environment has been considered a reality. However, it is only in recent years that it has become truly viable thanks to improvements in technology, such as telecommunications infrastructure and low-energy computing power.
The facet of daily life, this project aims to examine and expand upon is that of the interface between marketeer and consumer. With the rise of the web, e-commerce and online advertising there was an impact on old media and how end users would interact with the products and services they used or were exposed to.
The experience of engagement between consumer and provider has become more and more important as our post-industrial society has developed, the product or service itself is not the only differentiator, now the relationship as a bond between the two parties is increasingly prized as a means to ensuring repeat business from returning customers.
Brand loyalty is a somewhat intangibale target that businesses aim for to secure success but enabling anything within this realm of influence leads to someting something...
<What to talk about now?
Once we agree on one ting, what do we agree on?
There's a whole that needs filling
The reason for that hole it?
Once we ovecome certain mental shifts we will be able to take on more significant concepts as though they were inherently integral to our worldview.
Our collective ideas are intensivised but that doesn't diminish the notion that we have things to adhere to as citiziens of the greater good.
