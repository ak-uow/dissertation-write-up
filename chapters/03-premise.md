#Background Context

The convergence of technologies has often had the ability to transform they way we live; the smartphone is a prime example of how many elements come together to create something deeper and richer than the constituent parts alone. The Internet of Things is a paradigm that will create a phenomenon as equally transformative as the smartphone but with the capacity to extend
beyond our pockets and our hands, instead created a feeling of connectedness that immerses us within our environment in a way as yet unrealised.
For over a decade the potential for a digitally connected environment has been considered a reality. However, it is only in recent years that it has become truly viable thanks to improvements in technology, such as telecommunications infrastructure and low-energy computing power.
The facet of daily life, this project aims to examine and expand upon is that of the interface between marketeer and consumer. With the rise of the web, e-commerce and online advertising there was an impact on old media and how end users would interact with the products and services they used or were exposed to.
