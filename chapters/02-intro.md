# Introduction

Our physical and digital environments are becoming more & more overcrowded with advertising; increasingly, the intended audience is acclimated to the noise of current forms of advertising media.
The question for future advertising, is how to create more captivating interactions that stand-out from the competition while delivering deeper relationships between user & brand? 
In the near future, the overlapping concepts of Proximity Marketing and Pervasive Advertising are likely to converge in ways that create context aware interactions, triggered by the user's location which are able to provide richer engagement with the user; by leveraging data that is not available to traditional forms of advertising, like personal data or environmental data the new forms of interactive physical advertising will be able to connect with their audience to a degree greater than ever before. 
Up until now, only online advertising has been able to take advantage of contextual data and user data to deliver more relevant advertising to the user; the advent of the Internet of Things, which promises to lead to ubiquitous computing, creates a paradigm shift where all sort of objects and locations will be online and connected to data sources. 
With this new found power, the interaction between the physical space and people needs to be well executed lest it invoke negative reactions from consumers, that is to say users may not feel comfortable with these new experiences should they appear to infringe on privacy. 
What will be needed is a well balanced approach to instigating these new interactive experiences and requesting consensual use of personal data.
All that being said, the purpose of this study has been to create a series of interactive adverts that test audience perceptions to novel forms of advertising. 
Of course there are limitations as to what can be tested in one study, so these advertising experiences were built around a core premise, that an Internet of Things enabled physical space would be the trigger point for an advertisement that would be launched on a user's smartphone.
The other technologies that were being explored in the study were Social Media, Augmented Reality and a form of Digital Reward.
Seven variations were constructed based on the control experiment and all eight experiments were presented to participants of the study over course of ten days such that they were able to compare and contrast the experiences.
The user experience experiments were conducted in a fictional context, using a mocked environment which had been set up within some hired office space, with users sourced through online community forums and from local businesses.
Once the data had been gathered, the data was analysed in various ways in an attempt derive conclusive evidence as to which type of advertisment would be most effective and for which demographic of the population.
What follows is a documentation of the work involved creating the content, running the user experience studay, and the results it delivered.
