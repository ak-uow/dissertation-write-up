# Methodology

## Literature survey

Supporting secondary data will be acquired through university library resources and search features as well as Google Scholar; external providers of research papaers such as Springer, IEEE and ACM will be used to gather relevant papers. Other relevant material will be collected if it extremely pertinent and insufficient academic content exists; examples sources would be online publications, blogs, company websites and corporate whitepapers and case studies. Where possible long form literature such as books will be sourced but given the bleeding-edge nature of the project most artifacts will be journal articles and research papers or online sources. All secondary research will be collated and categorised with a reference manager (RefWorks) in order to help organise the body of research and search through the contents.  These secondary sources will be used to inform and frame the user testing, analysis and findings.

## Technical research

Given the scope of the project, it is not possible to deliver the project in the given time frame without taking advantage of third party libraries; the intent is to investigate the relevant open-source libraries that are suitable to assist in realising the implementation. This research will be documented, with justifications provided for the libraries and any other software chosen for inclusion in the project.

## Implementation

The development will be composed of many parts: Initially, the main concern will be ability to configure an IoT beacon to advertise a website so that an Android smartphone is notified and directed to that particular URL; the next phase will be to create static web content (using HTML, CSS and JavaScript) to fulfil the remit of each experiment; after this a test runner will need to be created, which will provide a method of hosting the web content for each experiment, with various features like, allowing sequential running of experiments, randomisation of order and resetting the test environment.
After the user testing research has been conducted the aim will be to create a ... user friendly web interface
