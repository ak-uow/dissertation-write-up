# Methodology

## Literature survey

Supporting secondary data will be acquired through university library resources and search features as well as Google Scholar; external providers of research papaers such as Springer, IEEE and ACM will be used to gather relevant papers. Other relevant material will be collected if it extremely pertinent and insufficient academic content exists; examples sources would be online publications, blogs, company websites and corporate whitepapers and case studies. Where possible long form literature such as books will be sourced but given the bleeding-edge nature of the project most artifacts will be journal articles and research papers or online sources. All secondary research will be collated and categorised with a reference manager (RefWorks) in order to help organise the body of research and search through the contents.  These secondary sources will be used to inform and frame the user testing, analysis and findings.

## Technical research

Given the scope of the project, it is not possible to deliver the project in the given time frame without taking advantage of third party libraries; the intent is to investigate the relevant open-source libraries that are suitable to assist in realising the implementation. This research will be documented, with justifications provided for the libraries and any other software chosen for inclusion in the project.

## Implementation

### Design
The design phase will be conducted in Lean UX manner, to deliver minimum viable products for each experiment; there will be a proto-persona to work with when creating basic wire-frames and wire-flows describing each user journey. The wire-frames and wire-flows will be minimal, rather than desigj visual and will be used only to provide guidelines for the prototypes.

### Development
The development will be composed of many parts: Initially, the main concern will be ability to configure an IoT beacon to advertise a website so that an Android smartphone is notified and directed to that particular URL; the next phase will be to create static web content (using HTML, CSS and JavaScript) to fulfil the remit of each experiment; after this a test runner will need to be created, which will provide a method of hosting the web content for each experiment, with various features like, allowing sequential running of experiments, randomisation of order and resetting the test environment.
For the sake of quick prototyping, where possible the code base will primarily be JavaScript to be run on NodeJS, acting as an HTTP server or command line interface. Other languages will be used where necessary.
Supporting software such as GitHub for versioning and Trello for project management will be used to track progress.

#### Extra Development
After the user testing research has been conducted the aim will be to create a user friendly web interface, effectively a CMS tailored to the task of linking beacons with web-based content. This effort is a secondary goal, acting as a proof-of-concept for offering commercial software for retailers with to easily distribute this form of location based interactive content. It should rte-use parts fo the tst runner but allow for more flexiblilty and ease of use thanks to a database driven GUI.

## Data collection and sampling
During the practical research phase, a fictional scenario will be constructed as the context for the physically initiated digital interaction; user testing participants will be given some basic idea of the premise of the situation and what to do to begin the the user journey; no other guidance will be provided for particpants so that they can be observed as impartially as possible when interacting with each user journey. Observations will be noted as the participants undertake each experiment and once a particpant has finished all tests they will be asked to complete a questionnaire to gather qualitiative and quantitative data about the entire experience.

### Ethics and consent
The users will be picked as to be those considered of sound body and mind and adults over the age of 18; these particpants will be required to complete a consent form informing them of the purpose of the research, allowing them to opt-out, request further information and agree for the data they provide to be used as part of the body of research. User data will be anonymised in order to safegaurd the privacy of the participants.

### Validity of research
In order to ensure that the data gathered isn't skewed based on learnt behaviour from one experiment to the next, the order in which the experiments are run will be randomised, with the exception of the control, baseline experiment which will always go first and will serve to set expectations. In this way, the research gathering should not create a bias for any particular experiment.
