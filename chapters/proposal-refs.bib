	title={Augmented Reality Web Applications with Mobile Agents in the Internet of Things},
	publisher={IEEE},
	pages={54-59},
	abstract={Augmented reality (AR) is a promising technology for building applications in an Internet of Things (IoT) environment, utilized for visualizing information provided by IoT devices. In this paper, we enable Web-based mobile AR applications with mobile agents in a resource-oriented IoT system architecture. We present an adaptable mobile agent composition that contains the data representation logic and mappings between AR applications and system resources. Thus, mobile agents and AR application-specific data structures are exposed as global system resources. System resource linkages are considered between real-world objects and their virtual representations for mobile agent-based AR applications. The agent composition also complies with the REST principles for resource access and control system-wide. This allows dynamic runtime adaptation and addressing the device and resource heterogeneity, thus eliminating the need for application-specific communication protocols. Moreover, we utilize a Web-based mobile AR application framework, running completely in a Web browser, which facilitates straightforward AR application development. Lastly, a proof of concept mobile AR application is implemented, where a coffee maker with a visual tag is connected to a low-power resource-constrained wireless sensor network node as an IoT device. A mobile agent is injected into the IoT environment to expose the state changes of the coffee maker. Through the visual tag, AR applications are able to visualize the state changes of the coffee maker in their user interface.},

	journal={Business Horizons},
	volume={52},
	number={4},
	pages={357-365},
	note={This paper exemplifies how social media has real value for brands promoting their products or services thanks to its ability to mix the customer word of mouth, peer to peer communication, with the traditional 'broadcast' mode of brand promotion. The argument is that this form of blended communication is able to increase consumer engagement. The paper goes on to outline techniques and strategies to maximise on the prospective&nbsp; increase in engagement. It is this element of the paper that is so pertinent to this thesis proposal, which is similarly, looking to find the most compelling user experience within the defined scope.},
	abstract={&nbsp; The emergence of Internet-based social media has made it possible for one person to communicate with hundreds or even thousands of other people about products and the companies that provide them. Thus, the impact of consumer-to-consumer communications has been greatly magnified in the marketplace. This article argues that social media is a hybrid element of the promotion mix because in a traditional sense it enables companies to talk to their customers, while in a nontraditional sense it enables customers to talk directly to one another. The content, timing, and frequency of the social media-based conversations occurring between consumers are outside managers' direct control. This stands in contrast to the traditional integrated marketing communications paradigm whereby a high degree of control is present. Therefore, managers must learn to shape consumer discussions in a manner that is consistent with the organization's mission and performance goals. Methods by which this can be accomplished are delineated herein. They include providing consumers with networking platforms, and using blogs, social media tools, and promotional tools to engage customers. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

While technologies that can sense the environment are advanced, questions such as what to sense and how to adapt context are largely unanswered. In this paper, we analyze the purchase context of a retail outlet and suggest a context model for adaptive pervasive commerce. Furthermore, we introduce one approach how to conceptualize context that may be applied to conceptualize context for adaptive pervasive advertising applications so that they really deliver on their potential: showing the right message to the right recipient at the right time.}

	note={This article from a 2006 issue of Pervasive Computing provides an example of how a phone can be the vehicle of an interaction but the instigator of the interaction is an external physical element using some form of radio technology. Moreover, the ideas&nbsp; described in the article are of similar intent to this thesis proposal but demonstrate that after over a decade of technological progress, the means of implementation will differ and it is worth seeing if that will make any significant difference to the outcome.

	abstract={As the vision of pervasive computing gradually becomes a reality, we are seeing an increasing number of services in our everyday environments. We don't just access them at desktop computers but everywhere our activities lead us-using mobile terminals and built-in technology. Although a positive phenomenon, this transition also introduces considerable challenges to discovering and selecting services. The authors propose a general framework for requesting pervasive services by touching RFID tags. Visual symbols communicate to users the objects that they can touch and that activate services. When a user touches such a symbol with a mobile phone, the data stored in the tag and other contextual information related to the situation trigger the requested service. The authors designed a set of visual symbols and implemented the required functionality as component-based middleware. They studied this novel system's usability and user experience. This article is part of a special issue on RFID Technology.},

	abstract={This paper introduces our research on influencing the experience of people in urban public places through mobile mediated interactions. Information and communication technology (ICT) devices are sometimes used to create personal space while in public. ICT devices could also be utilised to digitally augment the urban space with non-privacy sensitive data enabling mobile mediated interactions in an anonymous way between collocated strangers. We present what motivates the research on digital augmentations and mobile mediated interactions between unknown urban dwellers, define the research problem that drives this study and why it is significant research in the field of pervasive social networking. The paper illustrates three design interventions enabling social pervasive content sharing and employing pervasive presence, awareness and anonymous social user interaction in urban public places. The paper concludes with an outlook and summarises the research effort.},

	abstract = 	 {Abstract:           Modern communication is moving toward a digital paradigm influenced by increasing connectivity and the IoT. Digital communication can be improved by applying proximity rules to improve relevance especially for  marketing  messages.  The  objective  of  this  study  was  to  demonstrate  how  cloud  based  proximity marketing can be implemented as a service on existing wireless connectivity service platforms to deliver messages that are timely and relevant, using Wi-Fi broadcasts. Information about networking technologies and proximity determination was used to develop a prototype proximity marketing system to demonstrate the concepts of Proximity Marketing as a Service that can run on a wireless network. The prototype system Precinct PMaaS was successfully designed, implemented and tested. When compared to similar Bluetooth tools the cloud based WiFi driven Precinct PMaaS solution proved to be more efficient and effective, offering a better value proposition than Bluetooth proximity marketing tools. This study demonstrates how to achieve proximity communication cost effectively using network service information, demonstrated in a Wi-Fi only environment. This is ground work on which future projects can apply Big Data analytics to improve impact of proximity driven digital marketing.},

According to one embodiment, companies or marketers generate content (e.g., advertising content) to be distributed to mobile devices of consumers as those consumers become geographically proximate to physical locations associated with the companies or marketers. According to one embodiment, a central application server is used for purposes of generating and managing marketing content, and that content is transmitted to various client devices, routers, and/or servers (e.g., “plug” computers) for further distribution to mobile devices within a proximate range of the client devices. In one aspect, the client devices identify consumer mobile devices within a predetermined geographic area that is proximate to the client devices (e.g., based on a media access control (MAC) address associated with the mobile device), and push marketing content to those mobile devices for display to the consumers.},

	note={This article in the Harvard Business Review from the late 1990s is a well regarded document cited as the origin of the term 'Experience Economy' and all that entailed. To sum up, the authors Pine and Gilmore extrapolated that businesses mature over time from selling goods, to services and then experiences; even the businesses that still sell goods or services, tend to offer services or experiences - perhaps for free - as part of their offering to consumers. This is because as any given market matures and becomes more competitive, the consumer becomes more sophisticated in their expectations of what a company should offer and what kind of relationship should exist between provider and consumer. It's this shift to experience being such an important element of the retail dynamic that still makes this angle relevant, especially for touch points that have untapped potential like point-of-sale and physical advertising.},

While AR can play a valuable role in integrated marketing programs, little is known about the practice and how to execute effective AR programs in the marketplace. We address this gap by presenting a framework that describes the active and passive ingredients of augmented reality. We then describe the basic design decisions that marketers need to make when planning an augmented reality campaign. In addition, we explain how understanding and addressing the dynamics between various active and passive AR ingredients can help marketers to optimize their AR campaigns and enhance various types of consumer engagement: user-brand engagement, user-user engagement, and user-bystander engagement. Through our framework and analysis, we develop eight actionable recommendations—described with the acronym ENTANGLE—marketing managers can use to design immersive AR experiences that maximize consumer engagement.
