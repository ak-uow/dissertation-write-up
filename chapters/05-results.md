# User Research Results

This chapter provides a selection of data presentations, be that in tabular form, graphical representation or both. 
The assessment of the qauntitive data spans over 50 sides of A4 and the aggregation of qualitative data is a similar length, so it's impractical to present all the data in this chapeter.
The entire set of data evaluation can be found as part of the appendices.

## Basic Particpant Data 

What follows is some minimal demographic information about the 23 particpants that made up the group of experiment testers, as well as some information concerning their experience with technology relevant to the study.

There participants were mostly male be a ratio of about 3:2, the younger age groups were better represented, however the gender disparity was greater among those younger age groups with a stronger male representation for those under 35 (about 5:2). This was down to the participants that were able to take part.
