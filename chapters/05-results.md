#Final Outcome

The intended final outcome is in three-parts: firstly, to conduct the research a framework of tools will need to be written to enable the tests to be run several times over; the second part is the report of the findings, which should point to the best blend of technology. interaction design & user experience for positive user feedback; the last deliverable would be a proof-of-concept web platform as a means of deploying this new form of advertising.

## Experiments and test runner
This will be a collection of static HTML, CSS, JavaScript that will be accompanied by a simple application that will allow for the sequential hosting of the experiments on a local HTTP server.

## Report of findings
This deliverable is essentially the main body of vocational research and the report following analysis of the results obtained. Essentially this will be part of the main content of the thesis document as well as supporting evidence in an appendix section. This appendix is likely to include an example of the questionnaire and a copy of the anonymised data from respondents' answers.

## Web interface
The completeness of the web interface will be dependant on time but ideally it will present the user with a Web App GUI for a content management system that will host configurations for physical advertising, in a manner that allows for the easy deployment of instructional data to the IoT Beacons as well as the deployment of web-based advertising content to be hosted (either locally or online). This will demonstrate the potential for turning this body of research into a commercial product.
