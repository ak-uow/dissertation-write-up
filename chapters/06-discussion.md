# Interpretation and Conclusion

## Participant Concerns

As is to be be expected with this form interaction with technology, not all of the feedback was positive. 
This section aims to record the most highlight the prevalent sentiments that were wary of or absolutely in opposition to the entire idea of this form of interaction.
What follows are some excerpts from the qualitative feedback that exemplify some of the most popular or interesting concerns.

> as there were several steps to go through, although i enjoyed the interactive element, when you are in a rush and on the go you might not have time to play the game

> Firstly thank you for being welcoming and supportive. My experience of these experiments has been to recognise how much technology intrudes into purchasing experiences and my view is that the more our purchasing is tracked by technology the more our freedoms and autonomy are threatened. 
I am very ambivalent now about loyalty incentives because they track my life and I find this intrusive. Most people are involved with social media and this technology re-in-forces the power of social media. This is of concern to me, especially as I am aware of the risks to mental health that social media presents and especially to young people who I believe are mainly targetted by this technology.

> Massively disliked the social media aspect, especially if there’s no reward

> A little apprehensive sharing something trivial like a drink preference to my social media feed

> I’m sorry but there is not anything persuasive about this. 
I don’t care about the coins as they are worth 1000th of a penny or whatever and when I look in my email I will find emails telling me that I have earnt very little so this could be a source of annoyance each time I use a vending machine

> worrying trend increasing of contactless fraud and phone hacking- would need to see better use of phone payment as simply being in the same room sets it off

> I think there needs to be an option for people to take their drink and go rather than engage in the technology. 
The technology might be welcomed by some people but not everyone wants to go through this especially giving their email address.

The quotes above are taken directly from participant feedback. These citations reflect concerns that were not exclusive to the individuals but also expressed in other words by other testers.
It is clear that there will be some resistance to this form of advertising, not least because people are becoming more aware of how valuable their personal information is and that they would rather maintain a higher level of privacy that has previously been the norm.
This attitude is not shared across all ages though, and younger age groups were less likely to voice this sort of concern, especially if the interaction was swift.
Sharing one's relationship with a brand also seems to perceived in a poor light in a general sense and especially if there is no obvious incentive for doing so.
Additionally, the reward for engaging with the experience needs to be as clear as possible in order to deliver a positive feedback loop. 
If users are not given a concrete idea of what they have to gain, they are far less likely to take part and consequently, even less likely to propagate the idea.

## Scope for Improvement

> The AR element is fun for being new(ish) and different, but forcing the customer to stay near the vending machine to play might put me off. I could feel awkward standing in front of the machine or i might have places to be. | |would be good to reward for things like - coins go to your favourite charity / rewards for using provided bins - maybe using qi codes to register disposal etc. and reward | |No social media, make rewards better or make prizes traded for rewards amazing, AR game better or not at all, email okay (to be expected) but only in return for coins or not at all - all other aspects good | |The social media element needs more incentive, and there should be more explanation on why I am getting the notification and how it benefits me before i am asked to do anything, the gaming thing is fun - but if you’re in a rush it would be good to be able to have an option to ‘play later’ | |Game with coin was best - however also shorter versions of this advert |

> i like the game idea, especially if its fun and quick. Making the game result tied to the amount of fave coins awarded could make the game more engaging and make me look forward to buying my next can of sweet sweet Fave!

> I do believe that there would be added value if the app were to have a login that offered a loyalty card and was added as a smartphone wallet so that one could chose there favourite drink and just automatically wave their phone at the vending machine pick up their drink and leave.

There were many suggestions that were specific to the experiments and the features therein; 
the full report in the appendix documents these suggestions but as they are, generally speaking, comments around implementation details they are not sufficiently abstract to be considered applicable to the entire study.
One suggestion that was frequently mentioned was in relation to the nature of the Digital Reward:
Firstly a more explicit declaration of how many points would better compel the user;
if the interface were able to display the user's entire accumulation of Digital Reward this would also help motivate the user to collect points;
if the interaction could message a suggested value of accrued points in terms of a real world commodity this would help to give meaning to the Digital Reward.

While the augmented reality game was more of a proof-of-concept demonstration, some feedback around this part of the experience was quite insightful with regards to a real world implementation:
it could be more challenging, a certain level of difficulty could make it more interesting;
the game could influence the reward, should a reward be offered, the better you perform the more points you get;
if the augmented reality marker that instigated the game was on the bottle label rather than the vending machine then people could play the game away from the original location.

## Interpretation of Results

## Probable Audience

Given that the starting point for these interactive advertisements is the use of a mobile phone as a means of payment in reality this form of marketing is only going to be exposed to those that are comfortable with using their mobile phone as a wallet. 
Additionally there is the assumption that the user has Bluetooth enabled on their smart phone. 
With that in mind the feedback data suggests that the target market is under forty years of age and more likely to be female.  
In contrast if the use of augmented reality is part of the real world experience then the demographic that engages most is more likely to be male. 

## Efficacy of Characteristics

Discerning meaning from the feedback is not straight forward but it's clear that certain elements are more compelling than others. 
The social media element was widely eschewed which was expressed not only in the qualitative feedback but also in the quantitative scoring of the experiments that included this feature.
The worst performing experiment was #4 which only used social media on top of the baseline.
Users also tended to prefer an experience that was relatively quick so experiment #8 which was composed of every possible aspect of the study was not regarded favourably, not just because of the inclusion of social media but also because the interaction was prolonged relative to the other experiments.
All experiments that had an element of reward for the user scored well, with experiment #3 scoring highest and being composed only of the baseline and Digital Reward feature. 
The augmented reality experience was polarising being broadly well received by younger demographics and not the older age groups, but it was most effective when combined with Digital Reward.
Looking at the best performing experiments compared to the baseline allows for the composite features of them to be compared independently of the common characteristics of all experiments. 

## Further Research {.page-break-before}

Eight unique experiments were created to be compared against one another with the intent of finding which were the most successful at generating a positive connection between a person and a commercial product. 
As described in the methodology for the design of the study there are potentially many more variations. 
A more thorough undertaking would include variations that are not present in this study and are composed of the same elements but ordered differently. 
Nevertheless the findings from this study can be used as a way of refining which elements to explore in more detail; 
considering this, any further research can omit the social media aspect and expand the study of location based interactive advertisements involving incentives and playfulness.
