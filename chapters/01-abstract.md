**Abstract**

The purpose of this thesis was to explore various user experiences simulating a location based interaction with an wirelessly connected physical device, acting as the trigger of a web-based, smartphone pervasive advertising experience. 
Different user experiences were presented to user research participant for evaluation and comparison, all diverging from one common control experiment.
The advertisements combine various technologies such that base on participant feedback the best combination can be identified; 
these elements are Social Media, Digital Rewards, and Augmented Reality. The core of all advertisements is constant, that being the use of a Bluetooth Internet of Things notification that invokes the smartphone interaction.
This document covers the design of the study and consequent outcome which suggest which demographics out of the UK population would be most likely to engage in this form of advertising and also which combinations are most effective.
